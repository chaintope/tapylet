// Adding a network switch changed where chain data lives: pending transactions
// and issued token records are now namespaced per network (see
// ./adapters/prefixed). Installs that predate the switch wrote those keys
// unprefixed, so without this they would simply stop being found. Pending
// transactions would merely be re-fetched, but an issued token record holds the
// payment base, outpoint and metadata needed to file its registry
// registration — none of which can be recovered once the key is orphaned.
